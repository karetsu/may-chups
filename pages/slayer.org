* Gameplan
- Hoops are great, p hoop especially as he doesn't really have any answers to this unless he has 50 meter
- 5k the universe, its amazing in this matchup
- do not use 5h to poke
- fd when he's close and 1fj out but beware 2s, stupid button
- when he is outside of 2h range he can only really come in with 5 things [2d, 6h, mappa, iad, dot]
- aim to keep him outside of his 2h and bbu range and really frustrate him
- j.h if he starts to get jumpy
